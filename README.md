# hackintosh-full-installer
Repo for a script that can complete part of the task of creating a full Hackintosh installer entirely from Linux.

This script is based on instructions in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqK-dUdChwE) which is Part 1 of a two part series explaining how to create a full installer for macOS created using tools in Windows.

This script contains most of the commands needed to partition, format and add macOS installation files as illustrated in that YouTube video but the commands can be run entirely in Linux.

None of these programs are needed: Boot Disk Utility or Paragon Partition Manager or Paragon HFS+ for Windows.

#### Acknowledgments
**cvad** the developer of [Boot Disk Utility](http://cvad-mac.narod.ru/index/bootdiskutility_exe/0-5) provided valuable help with commands to extract and write the Apple Disk Image to a USB drive.
